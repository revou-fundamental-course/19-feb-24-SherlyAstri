            <h2>History of Miscomputer</h2>
            <p class="center-align">In 2020, when the world was faced with the significant challenge posed by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself embarking on an intriguing journey into the world of technology. Initially, this exploration began with a simple curiosity, prompting me to delve deeper into the realm of technology as a means of distraction from the uncertain circumstances. However, from that curiosity, grew a deep-seated interest, guiding me to explore further and apply the knowledge I gained in my daily life.

                As time passed, what initially started as a mere hobby evolved into an inseparable habit from my daily routine. Every day, I set aside time to learn, experiment, and innovate in the field of technology, finding joy and satisfaction in pursuing new knowledge and developing existing skills.
                
                By the time 2022 arrived, the world had begun to adapt to the new situation, seeking ways to remain productive and connected amidst the pandemic. At the same time, the business I pursued had begun to gain broader recognition and developed into a more established entity. The decision to deepen my knowledge and skills in technology had a positive impact on my business, enabling me to overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities.
                
                To date, I am grateful to see that my business has grown significantly, successfully penetrating the local market and achieving satisfying success. However, this journey has only just begun. With strong determination and fervent spirit, I am committed to continuing to develop this business to reach even higher levels. I dream of seeing this business expand and spread worldwide, providing tangible benefits to the global community and leaving a meaningful legacy in the history of the technology industry..</p>
